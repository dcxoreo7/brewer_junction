			<h3>City Events</h3>
			<p>This past Saturday, September 9, was the annual "Brew" tasting took place starting at 9:00 AM.  The "Brew" was on 2nd and Brew Street where there was over 200 local breweries ready to have there beers tasted.  The community had such a huge turnout as well as surrounding communities.  This event has been said to be the world's largest beer tasting for the last 7 years.  We would like to send a huge thanks to the Breweries and to all the people who came out to create another huge turnout for a very popular local event.</p>

			<p>  Saturday night there was also a parade followed by fireworks as a night event for all the people who went to the famous "Brew" tasting.  The fire department raised money for fireworks by having the community donate pop cans and bottles.  The turnout was seen to be the biggest in the past 3 years.  As for the parade, the community got involved with life by cheering and participating in many of the floats' music and dancing.</p>

			<h3>Weather</h3>
			<p>Over the weekend Brewer Junction was hit by a raging storm that had winds up to 40 mph.  Locals said that the town received a &frac12; inch of rain but our meter read &frac34; inch.  This was good for the town as local farmers struggled with crops lacking water needed to have a positive turn out.  Many farmers were beginning to worry whether or not their crops would produce due to the lack of water within the last few months but with all the rain that was received on Saturday and all the rain seen to be heading they have lowered their stress and worry levels.  Weather this week is visioned as being mildly warm with temperatures in the 80's all week.  Low chance of rain early in the week followed by 75% chance of thunderstorms on Thursday night into Friday morning.  Should be a beautiful weekend for football with clear skies and 80 degree weather all weekend.</p>
